# R2: Width Machinery and More Families

Status: proposed
Lean home: theory/Theory/ProofComplexity/ (module split decided at adoption)

## Statement

1. Ben-Sasson-Wigderson width-size tradeoff in general form: short resolution
   refutations imply narrow refutations; quantitative version.
2. Width lower bounds, hence size lower bounds, for: random k-CNF at suitable
   clause density (Chvatal-Szemeredi) and Tseitin contradictions over expander
   graphs.

## Why this rung

The width method is the workhorse of resolution lower bounds; formalizing it in
general form turns R1-style results into a reusable machine. Expander-based Tseitin
bounds introduce the expansion toolkit needed at higher rungs.

## Falsification test

Calibration only: falsifier proof-size curves for random k-CNF around the
threshold density and for Tseitin instances; curves must match the known theory
(exponential at the relevant densities).

## Barrier notes

Same as R1: no applicable wall at resolution level. Expansion arguments are the
technique most likely to survive upward, worth auditing for reuse at R3 and R4.
